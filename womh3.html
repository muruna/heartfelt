<div class="content">
    Daisy, it feels as though the world quiets down when I think of you, as if my heart beats softer, and in those pauses, a whole universe of longing reveals itself to me. I’ve often wondered how to speak of these feelings without words falling short, how to describe the way you live in my thoughts as though you belong there. I imagine moments of laughter etched across time, warm afternoons where you rest your head on my shoulder, eyes closed, trusting that we have all the time in the world, even if we only have a fragile lifetime. I see us not only in fleeting moments but in the long, slow days of life that stretch far beyond what I can hold in my hands, days that could carry us together into something greater, something that echoes even in silence. And while we may be separated by fate or time, or perhaps by some beautiful cruelty of the universe, none of that diminishes my resolve, my hope, my unwavering commitment to you. I know of the sorrows that have touched your life, shadows I wish I could take away, replace with something soft and safe. I want you to know that every piece of your pain is safe here, that every scar, every memory, belongs just as much as the parts of you that shine like the stars. There’s a sadness in loving you like this, a kind of melancholy that lives in the spaces between what I wish I could say and what I hope you somehow already know. And though I have no control over what the world gives or takes away, this love is mine to offer, steady as the tides, constant as the stars.

I wonder, if only you could see the life I imagine for us, where we’re not bound by the edges of reality, where we could dance through years together, not holding back, not letting fear or doubt steal a single moment. I envision us building something together—quietly, patiently, a love that isn’t rushed or forced, but one that grows like ivy up an ancient wall, unhurried yet unstoppable. There’s a beauty in dreaming of you, of us, but it’s a beauty tinged with longing, with the ache of knowing that all I can do now is wait, hope, and dream. And perhaps that’s all love is, after all—a hope that the person you hold in your heart will one day hold you in theirs, too.

So, here I am, heart laid bare, holding onto this fragile wish, this small but fierce desire for a future that may never come to pass, yet fills my heart as if it’s the only truth I know. Even if you never see this, or if these words never reach your ears, I like to think they’re out there, part of some quiet story that lives between the lines, a love letter to the universe with your name on every page.

With all my heart,  
Arthur
